# Linear Regression
Linear Regression assumes that:
- All variables are continuous numeric, not categorical
- Data is free of missing values and outliers
- There's a linear relationship between predictors and predictant
- Residuals (predictions errors) are normally distributed

# Linear regression for a single predictor. 
Both predictor and predictant need to be python arrays
  Linear_Regression(predictor, predictant)

# Linear regression for multiple predictor
Add here...

# Logistic regression
Logistic regression modeling assumes that:
- The data is free of missing values
- The predictant variable is _binary_ (it only accetps two values) or _ordinal_ (a categorical variable with ordered values)
- All predictors are independent of each other
- There are at least 50 observations per predictor variable (to ensure reliable results)



# K-Means
In order to use this method first you need to:
- Scale your variables
- Look at a scatter plot or the data table to estimate the appropriate number of centroids to use for the K parameter value
