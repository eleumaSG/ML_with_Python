# Linear Regression
Linear Regression assumes that:
- All variables are continuous numeric, not categorical
- Data is free of missing values and outliers
- There's a linear relationship between predictors and predictant
- Residuals (predictions errors) are normally distributed

# Linear regression for a single predictor. 
Both predictor and predictant need to be python arrays
  Linear_Regression(predictor, predictant)
